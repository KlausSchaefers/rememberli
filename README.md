# Rememberli

 RememberLi is a simple note-taking app, that is focussed on finding and remembering the important things in your life.

### Concept

The app is built around three main concepts:

1. A simple markup language that supports to highlight important elements in a note and help you to find the right notes.
2. A powerful search engine that allows you to find and filter all your notes. It support *magic* commands like "due", "#tag" or "@person" search with smart auto complete.
3. Notes are taken in a chronological order and this order is perserved, even when you filter the list of Notes with the search function.

In addition, you can also set reminders. When a note is due, it will be indicated with a red bar.
